# Manage users React.js practice

Part of my React learning exercise, this is a user list table that expects name, email, and a date (not really a _date_ yet) from a form with basic validation.

## Demo
  - `npm install` and then `npm start` locally,
  - or go to [igorlanko.github.io/manage-users-react](https://igorlanko.github.io/manage-users-react).

## How to publish
- `npm run predeploy` will build the app;
- `npm run deploy` will publish to repo's GitHub page.
  
## Local requirements
- `Node.js` installed on machine;
- `React.js`;
- `TailwindCSS`
